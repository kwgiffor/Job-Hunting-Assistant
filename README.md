LLM Resume Tailoring App

This app uses an MVC architecture and is built in C# using ASP.NET. It allows users to input a resume and a job listing, and the app will generate a new resume that is tailored to the specific requirements of the job. The app uses commercial LLMs to identify the keywords and phrases that are most relevant to the job listing, and then it uses this information to rewrite your resume in a way that is more likely to be noticed by hiring managers.
